# Workflow Manager

This was just a project for me to mess around with Deno...currently the code is in a broken state...so judge lightly!

## Getting Started

This project uses [deno](https://deno.land) which is a secure Javascript and Typescript runtime created by the original creator of `nodeJS`

You can easily install `deno` by running the following command, note: you must have homebrew installed

## Installing Deno

```
brew install deno
```

## Run Tests

```
deno test --importmap=import_map.json
```
